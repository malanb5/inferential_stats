## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
carAcc <- data.frame("County" = c(1:10), "Pre-Test" = c(8, 7, 6, 9, 10, 5, 7, 11, 8, 7), "Post-Test" = 
                       c(5, 6, 4, 6, 5, 3, 2, 9, 4, 4))
carAcc$Diff <- carAcc$Pre.Test - carAcc$Post.Test
sd(carAcc$Diff)
```
